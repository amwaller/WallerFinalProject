        <p class="caption">The 2021 U.S. Census Data reveals that married women who gave birth in the last 12 months are more likely to be living in poverty than unmarried women. These findings highlight the economic challenges faced by new mothers in the United States.</p>

      <p>Nearly 4 million women ages 15-50 had a birth in the United States in the past year. Among these women, nearly 2 million were married and living 200% below the poverty level, while only 415,000 were unmarried and in the same economic bracket.</p>
      <p>The Census data revealed geographical differences in the number of births among women. States located in the Midwest, such as North Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Texas, were among the states with the highest number of births per 100 residents. These states had birth rates ranging from 6.04 to 6.89 births per 100 residents.</p>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/2021-poverty-guidelines">U.S Federal Poverty Guidelines</a> the poverty level for a family of four in the United States is $26,500, and 200% of that figure is $53,000. This means that women who had a birth in the past year and were living on an income of less than $53,000 for a family of four are considered to be living 200% below the poverty level.</p>
      <p>The data also reveals that the percentage of married women living 200% below the poverty level was lower in certain states, primarily those located in the South. Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, and South Carolina were among the states with a lower percentage of married women in this economic bracket. Mississippi had the lowest percentage among all states, with less than 35% of married women falling into this category.</p>

    <p>To better understand the differences between married and unmarried women living 200% below the poverty level, I spoke with Dr. Marcus Hunter, a sociologist and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. Hunter has conducted extensive research on poverty and its effects on families.</p>
    <p>"In my research, I have found that married women who are living in poverty face a unique set of challenges. They often have more financial responsibilities, such as supporting a partner or children, which can limit their ability to work or pursue education," said Dr. Hunter. "Additionally, married women are more likely to face social stigma if they are unable to provide for their families, which can further exacerbate their financial difficulties."</p>
    <p>Unmarried women who have a baby while living in poverty are more likely to have a support system, such as family or friends, who can help provide assistance. "Unmarried women may have more flexibility in terms of their living situation or employment, which can make it easier for them to access resources and support," he explained.</p>
    <p>The Census data highlights the need for policymakers and healthcare professionals to address the unique challenges faced by married women living in poverty. This includes expanding access to education and job training programs, as well as increasing financial assistance programs to support families.</p>
    <p>The data also underscores the importance of providing support and resources to all women who have recently given birth, regardless of their marital status or economic situation. "We know that the postpartum period is a critical time for women's health and well-being, and we need to ensure that all women have access to the resources they need to thrive," said Dr. Hunter.</p>

        <p>Credit and childcare subsidies, can help alleviate some of the economic burdens faced by low-income families. However, these policies are not always sufficient or accessible to those who need them most.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hunter adds that government policies, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and childcare subsidies, can help alleviate some of the economic burdens faced by low-income families. However, these policies are not always sufficient or accessible to those who need them most.</p>
        <p>"The data on women living 200% below the poverty level is a reminder that poverty and economic insecurity are ongoing challenges in our country," Dr. Hunter says. "We need to prioritize policies that address the root causes of poverty and support families in need."</p>
        <p>As the Biden administration and Congress consider the next steps in their economic agenda, this data serves as a stark reminder of the importance of addressing poverty and economic inequality in America. The economic struggles of families, particularly those headed by married couples, can have long-lasting impacts on maternal and child health, education, and economic mobility.</p>

        <p>Overall, the data shows that poverty continues to be a significant challenge for families in the United States, particularly for married women who are trying to provide for their families. However, by increasing access to resources and support, we can help ensure that all women and families have the opportunity to thrive.</p></div>
